      <h1>On the spectral radius of weight matrices in RNNs</h1>
      <p>
        When initializing the weight matrix (let's assume there is only one)
        in an RNN (recurrent neural network) it is said (e.g. by Ilya Sutskever
        in his PhD thesis) that you want the spectral radius (the size
        of the largest eigenvalue in absolute value) to be slightly less
        than $1$.
      </p>
      <p>
        A common way to initialize the weight matrix is,
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="code">
      <pre><code class="python">
  size = 100
  variance = 0.1
  W = np.random.randn(size, size)*variance
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        and then play with the variance until it works.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this post we'll do a bit of exploratory mathematics
        to prod the how the variance and size of a matrix, $W$,
        affects its spectral radius $\rho(W)$.
      </p>

      <h2>The distribution of the spectral radius</h2>
      <p>
        Since the spectral radius is somewhat difficult to
        work with theoretically, we'll take an experimental approach
        instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let $W_{n,v}$ be the random matrix of size $n$ with
        (zero mean) gaussian entries with variance $v$.
        The spectral radius is a random variable of these entries.
        How does the distribution of the spectral radius
        look for, say, $W_{10,2}$? Sampling
        a set of $10,000$ matrices from this distibution
        shows the result.
      </p>
      <img src="spectHist.png" width=700 />
      <p>
        It looks somewhat Poisson distributed.
        We could stop here, conjecture that it indeed is, and
        then try to prove it, but let's move on.
      </p>

      <h2>Fixing the matrix size</h2>
      <p>
        Typically when training RNNs the number of hidden units
        is first decided upon, and then you go about mucking with the variance.
        Below I've fixed the matrix size to $10$. I then
        changed the variance between $0.1$ and $10$, and looked at
        the <i>expected</i> spectral radius (since all
        we really care about is that $E\{ \rho(W)\} \approx 1$).
      </p>
      <img src="fixedMatrixSize.png" width=700 />
      <p>
        It looks linear! That's nice.
        The coefficient here is about $3$.
        Thus, for the case of $n=10$, we know
        that if our variance is, say, $v=0.1$,
        then the spectral radius will be about $\rho(W_{10,0.1}) = 0.3$.
      </p>

      <h2>Varying the matrix size</h2>
      <p>
        What if we train the network, and then decide
        that we'd really like more hidden units?
        Can we be sure that the spectral radius
        will stay the same (assuming we don't change the variance)?
      </p>
      <img src="varyingMatrixSize.png" width=700 />
      <p>
        Above I'm varying the size of the matrix,
        while looking at the proportion between the
        expected spectral radius and variance in the
        entries. It's not constant!
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, be aware that when increasing
        the size of a matrix then its spectral radius will
        also increase.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The conclusion of this post is basically
        just that if you have something like this in your code,
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="code">
      <pre><code class="python">
  size = 100
  variance = 0.1
  W = np.random.randn(size, size)*variance
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        then you should be aware that if you change the size
        of the matrix, then you'll also have to change
        the variance.
      </p>

      <h2>Fixing it</h2>
      <p>
        How could we go about fixing this?
        Preferably we'd like a theoretically motivated
        expression between the variance, size of the matrix,
        and spectral radius, so that we can
        ensure the radius is size-invariant
        (by automatically changing the variance).
      </p>
      <p>
        Doing it theoretically is a theorem
        for another day. But one
        ad hoc method often suggested
        is the following.
        (There are theoretical arguments,
        but I've never seen one from the perspective
        of trying to keep the spectral radius fixed.)
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="code">
      <pre><code class="python">
  size = 100
  variance = 0.1 / np.sqrt(size)
  W = np.random.randn(size, size)*variance
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
      <p>
        Amazingly, when we calculate the proportion
        between the expected spectral radius and the variance,
        as a function of the matrix size (using the normalization
        trick above), it's almost always at $\sim 1$.
      </p>
      <img src="normalizedVaryingMatrixSize.png" width=700 />
      <p>
        The conclusion is that when you
        want the spectral radius to remain
        fixed; just use the above instead.
      </p>
